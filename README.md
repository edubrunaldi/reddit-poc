## Looking for Developers?

This project represents my ongoing exploration of Spring Boot, Kotlin, and modular architecture. Although I'm current working with Springboot microservices architecture.

If you have an exciting project in mind that utilizes these technologies, I'd love to hear about it! I'm particularly interested in projects that:

    
* Leverage the scalability and maintainability of microservices architectures.
* Utilize the conciseness and expressiveness of Kotlin for clean APIs.
* Focus on building engaging and interactive user experiences.
